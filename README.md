sipphone-automation
===================

Robot Framework library for testing SIP Phones

To run this library you must currently have a Polycom phone running firmware that supports the Microbrowser that 
Polycom provides.

## Polycom Config File
In order for your Polycom phones to support this test you must add the following settings to one of the phones cfg files.
- apps.push.messageType=5
- apps.push.username=bob
- apps.push.password=1234
- apps.statePolling.password="admin"
- apps.statePolling.username="admin"
- apps.statePolling.responseMode="0"
- tone.dtmf.rfc2833Control="0" (This is if you want support for audio detection)

Below is a better example of this
```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<localcfg>
<apps apps.statePolling.password="admin" apps.statePolling.username="admin" apps.statePolling.responseMode="0" apps.push.messageType="5" apps.push.username="admin" apps.push.password="admin" apps.push.serverRootURL="http://10.10.10.1"/>
</localcfg>
```
